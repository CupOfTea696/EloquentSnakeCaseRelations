# Eloquent snake_case Relations

A simple trait to access your Eloquent relations using its snake_case property

## Installation

Install via composer by running `composer require cupoftea/eloquent-snake-relations`.

Once installed, Models created via the `make:model` command will automatically extend `CupOfTea\Database\Eloquent\Model` to allow relation access via the snake_cased relation name.

If you have already created some Models in your Application, simply replace the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` import with `CupOfTea\Database\Eloquent\Model`, or for Pivot Models, replace the `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot` import with `CupOfTea\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot`.

Alternatively, if you are extending your own Model class, you can use the `CupOfTea\Database\Eloquent\Concerns\HasSnakeCaseRelations` trait on that Model, or extend it from `CupOfTea\Database\Eloquent\Model` instead of `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`.

## Usage

To access your model relations, you can now use the snake_case property, even if your relation method is camelCase. For example, if your your relationship method is defined as `User::creditCards()`, you can access it via `$user->credit_cards`.

> **Note**: Please note that only property access can use snake_case. Additional relationship queries or eager loading should still use the relationship method name as is. For example, `$creditCards = User::find(1)->creditCards()->orderBy('expires')->get();`, or `$users = User::with('creditCards')->all();`
